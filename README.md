# Pedometer-Data-Set
In this project, all data is collected and stored with the consent and knowledge of the users and on real devices. In order to protect the privacy of the users, personal information and their identification are not included in this dataset. Instead, only the movement paths of the users are recorded, which allows us to analyze their behavioral patterns and interactions.

This approach helps us to gain a better understanding of user behavior without violating the privacy of individuals. By focusing on movement paths, we can obtain useful information about behavioral patterns, high-traffic points and users' needs. This information can be used to improve services and user experience, design intelligent systems and optimize processes.

We are committed to observing ethical and legal principles in collecting and using data and always pay special attention to protecting the privacy of users. For this reason, all data collection processes are carried out in compliance with data protection standards and no personal or identifying information is used.

Ultimately, our goal with this data collection is to improve the quality of services and improve the user experience using real-world data-based analytics, without affecting users' privacy.
